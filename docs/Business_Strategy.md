# Strategy: Consulting vs. SaaS

Use this guide to decide your go-to-market strategy for Shadow GPU.

## Quick Answer: The "Hybrid" Approach
**Start with Consulting** to build cash flow and perfect the product, then **transition to SaaS** for scale.

---

## 1. Consulting (The "Agency" Model)
*Best for: Months 1–12*

**How it works:** You rush in, install the agent, find the waste, and engage to fix it.
*   **Pricing:** High ($5,000 - $20,000 per project or % of savings).
*   **Sales Cycle:** Medium (requires trust, but ROI is obvious).
*   **Tech Requirement:** Low. The dashboard only needs to work for *you*. Bugs are hidden by your service.

**Pros:**
*   **Immediate Cash Flow:** One deal = $10k. SaaS would need 100 customers at $100/mo to match.
*   **Deep Learning:** You see exactly why customers are wasting money (bad code? lazy devs? legacy infra?), which improves your product.
*   **Zero Churn:** It's a project, not a subscription.

**Cons:**
*   **Unscalable:** Revenue is tied to your hours.
*   **Lower Valuation:** Service businesses sell for 2-3x profit, SaaS sells for 10x revenue.

## 2. SaaS (The "Product" Model)
*Best for: Year 2+*

**How it works:** Customers sign up, install the agent, and fix issues themselves via the dashboard.
*   **Pricing:** Low/Recurring ($500 - $2,000 / month).
*   **Sales Cycle:** Fast (Self-service or low-touch).
*   **Tech Requirement:** Ultra-High. The UI must be perfect, bug-free, and secure (SOC2).

**Pros:**
*   **Infinite Scale:** Code scales better than people.
*   **High Valuation:** Investors love ARR (Annual Recurring Revenue).
*   **Passive Income:** Money while you sleep.

**Cons:**
*   **Hard to Sell:** "Trust us to run code on your production cluster" is a hard sell for a new startup.
*   **Churn:** If they fix the waste in Month 1, why pay in Month 2? (The "Optimizer's Dilemma").

## The Winning Playbook

1.  **Phase 1: "Wizard of Oz" (Now)**
    *   Sell "GPU Audit Services".
    *   Use the Shadow Dashboard internally to do the work 10x faster than competitors.
    *   Charge for the **Result** (Savings), not the Tool.

2.  **Phase 2: "Productized Service" (6 Months)**
    *   Sell a monthly "Optimization Retainer".
    *   Give clients read-only access to the dashboard.
    *   You still manage the complex fixes.

3.  **Phase 3: "Pure SaaS" (18 Months)**
    *   Open sign-ups.
    *   Focus on "Auto-Remediation" features that justify a subscription (e.g., dynamic autoscaling).
    *   You exit the service loop.
