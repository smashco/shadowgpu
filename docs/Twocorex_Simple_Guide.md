## 1. What is it?
Imagine you have a giant toy room (your Cloud).
Sometimes, you leave the lights on when you aren't playing.
Sometimes, you rent a giant truck just to carry one small apple.

**Shadow GPU** is a **Magic Robot** that watches your toy room.
It tells you: *"Hey! Turn off that light!"* and *"Use a smaller truck!"*

## 2. How does it work?
1.  **The Watcher**: We put a tiny robot (Agent) on your computers.
2.  **The Thinking**: The robot sits quietly and writes down everything that happens. It checks if the computers are working hard or just sleeping.
3.  **The Report**: After 2 days, the robot gives us a **Story Book** (Audit Report).

## 3. How do we use it?

### Step 1: The Sticker (Install)
We paste one magic sticker (Command) on your computer system.
> `helm install shadow-agent`
*(This wakes up the robot.)*

### Step 2: The Nap (Wait)
We go to sleep for 2 days. The robot stays awake and watches.

### Step 3: The Treasure Map (Report)
We give you a paper that says:
*   "You have **5 Sleeping Computers**."
*   "If you turn them off, you find **$1,000**!"

### Step 4: The Prize (Fix)
You accept the help, we turn off the sleeping computers, and you keep the money!
